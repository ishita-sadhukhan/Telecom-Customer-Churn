# How can a telecom industry identify customers who are churning and stop them?

Customer loyalty is the key to profitability in the telecom industry. A telecom business sector can use this model to early identify customers who are most likely to leave their service and take preventive measures in order to retain them. Promotions and various discounted offers are often send to customers, however, customers who are probable churn require special attention. This machine learning model takes into different into different factors .... nalyzes all these factors deeply through visualization and statistical models, and thereby solves a huge problem of the telecom business.


Because telecom providers manage large fixed infrastructures that must be offset by revenue, customer churn (attrition) is particularly problematic in this industry.

Low switching costs for customers (supported by government regulations) mean that customer loyalty is the only real tool that telecom companies must have to reduce their churn rates.  Connected data, used to improve service quality, dynamically adjust pricing/promotions, and offer personalized content to consumers, enable telecom providers to influence customer loyalty and increase customer retention directly.
